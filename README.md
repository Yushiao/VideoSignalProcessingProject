# VideoSignalProcessingProject
## Image Coding Contest
Try to optimize the coding efficiency for YCbCr 4:2:0 images. The basic requirement is that the bitstream should contain all information the decoder need for reconstructing the image. There will  be  five  given  test  images  and  another  five  hidden  ones.  The  coding  efficiency  will  be evaluated based on R-D curves or BD-rate for the ten test images. The winners will be awarded by multiplying their project grades by a factor (the total point can be over 40). The first place prize is a factor of 1.1. The other prizes will depend on how many teams attend this contest.
